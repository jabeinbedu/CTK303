<!-- I decided to tinker with SVGs and Clipping Paths, as well as the CSS Animation. 

I picked to try to recreate Eve and Wall-E due to their relatively simple geometric forms, Wall-E in
the film has far detail so I decided to have him a frantic blur in the background of the page to avoid
that aspect for now. 

At first I tried out Clippy, but didn't have the flexibility I wanted. Then I tried
Clippy: https://bennettfeely.com/clippy/

Next was Vecta: https://vecta.io/ this was able to draw the body and face well enough,
but seemed a bit less oriented to why I was using it.

Ultimately my favorite for creating the SVG paths was SvgPathEditor, available here:
